# Discord Bot

This is a simple Discord bot. It can play music (although it does not autoplay, sadly). It can scrape ebay, solve math equations, among a bunch of random things.
 
 
## Getting started 
In order to use this Discord bot yourself, you will have to provide your own token in the token.env file. You can find a guide about getting your token 
[here](https://www.writebots.com/discord-bot-token/).

Before running the bot, you will have to install all the proper modules for python. So you will need python and pip installed and added to your PATH on your computer. This guide will not go over that.

To install all the requirements, `cd` to wherever you download these files, and run the command `pip -r install requirements.txt` this should download all the of the requirements. If it misses any, just be sure to download the modules that are missing if you run into any errors.

Once you have all the required modules and your token is set, you can run the bot by typing ``python discord_bot.py`` in your terminal. This should run the bot, or output any errors if anything went wrong. If the bot is working, you will see it logged in on your server and you can type !help in general chat to see the commands. (You can also private message the bot)``
